## Our core functionality are-
  1. User Authentication and Profiles
  2. Community Building
  3. Mental Wellness Resources
  4. Events and Workshops
  5. Support and Counseling

## User Auth-
  - For this we're using **PHP** along with **MONGODB** as the database. 
  - The idea is to have 2 login credentials for users and the counsellor respectively.

## User Experience-
  - With a variety of simple **services** we allow users to explore tranquility and calmness in their own ways.
  - For instance we have: a simulation, short music clips, a virtual tour etc.


## At SoulSync, we provide the following services:
  1. Music samples for calmness.
  2. Providing tips for improving sleep routines.
  3. Lossing yourself in the virtual tour powered by 'MatterPort' which shows a village of Kerambitan.
  4. Articles and Blogs.
  5. Last but not the least,live counselling sessions done through Google Meet.

# Tech Stack used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. PHP
